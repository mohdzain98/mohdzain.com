      <p className='justified'>In our study, we introduce a cryptosystem specifically designed for encrypting color images using the ⊗ operator. The underlying properties of this operator facilitate its dual use in both encryption and decryption processes. This functionality stems from its ability to form an Abelian group, characterized by its distributive and commutative properties. Our cryptosystem incorporates these characteristics in a unique sequence of operations that includes DNA encoding, substitution, and subsequent decoding, intertwined with a specialized mixing procedure preceded by inter channel mixing and mixing rows with initial array mapped from a chaotic map that exploits these mathematical properties of the ⊗ operator.</p>
      <br/>
      <p className='justified'>Further, our system is structured to simplify the decryption process by reversing specific changes applied during encryption, thus avoiding the complexity and computational intensity typically associated with multiple rounds of confusion and diffusion found in many current cryptosystems. This streamlined approach relies on basic computational tasks, significantly reducing the operational burden.</p>
