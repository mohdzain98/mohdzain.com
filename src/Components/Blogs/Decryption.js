            After obtaining cipher image we proceed for its decryption as on reciever side it needs to be decrypted. The encryption and decryption processes are inverted. The steps that are taken in last stages will now be taken in initial stages as we move in reverse fashion. As presented in flow chart, we again split the cipher images into R, G, B components and applies DNA encoding. If we compare encyption and decryption flow chart we can see we are dealing with DNAs in the later stages in encryption but in decryption we are using DNAs in initial stages. At first we do DNA encoding then we apply reverse DNA substitution using reverse substitution rules followed by DNA decoding. Encoding and Decoding have the same algorithm but substitution have minor change, it uses reverse substitution rules. After decoding we go for reverse spiral mixing which internally follows reverse fashion of mixing in encryption. Then we apply reverse modified ACM followed by reverse mix rows and reverse inter channel mixing. At last we again merge RGB into final decrypted image. The main point of decryption is to use the same key as it was used in encryption for getting 2D MCCM, initial vector, rules maps and DNA substitution map.<br/>

            The steps are shown ahead.

This reversal is typically achieved by applying an substitution rule with reverse algorithm that maps each DNA base pair or sequence back to its corresponding plaintext character or symbol.

                        <span className="text-decoration-underline">Reverse Spiral Mixing</span> : In reverse spiral mixing, the encryption process is essentially reversed to reconstruct the original image from its encrypted form. This technique involves applying mixing operations in a reverse fashion. There will be same four operations but their line of operation will be reversed. Among the four the last one in encryption will be the first one in decryption. <br/>
                        The four reversed steps are:
