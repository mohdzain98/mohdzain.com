            The goal of image cryptosystems is to protect image transmission
            when there are network adversaries present. To ensure secrecy,
            images are subject to encryption to produce unintelligible cipher
            images; the techniques used for this process differ significantly
            from those applied to text data. The majority of the cryptosystem
            consider complicated or confusion-diffusion architectures that
            changes and permute the values ofthe pixels. These frequently entail
            binary operations like bitwise XOR, plus-minus, DNA operations, etc;
            are carried out utilising chaotic maps, each of which have certain
            limitations. This paper employs a binary function that can be
            applied to both traditional and DNA techniques for coloured natural
            images, and can be applied to any kind of image cryptosystem. Each
            of thecolor component of the image follows some steps which start
            with inter channel mixing and mix rows which takes the value from
            initial vector and mixes it, then Arnold cat map algorithm is
            applied to shuffle the pixels. Secondly spiral mixing of the pixel
            is applied in four different directions to prevent differential
            attack. Finally, encoding, substitution, and decoding based on DNA
            is carried out. A multiple collapse chaotic map is used to derive
            initialization vector, rule charts and DNA substitution map which
            are used in encoding and decoding processes. Analysis and
            experimental findings shows that our cryptosystem has significant
            performance and different metrics shows it can withstand different
            type of attacks

          <p className="justified">
          DNA based color images refer to the encoding of the color images into DNA sequences called as DNA computing. The basic idea behind DNA
          computing is that DNA can be used to store and process information in
          a way that is similar to how a computer uses binary digits (bits) to
          represent data. Instead of representing images using traditional pixel
          values the image data is converted into a sequence of DNA
          nucleotides(A for Adenine, T for Thymine, C for Cytosine and G for
          Guanine). This process of converting color images's pixel values into
          a DNA sequence involve mapping the pixel value of a image to specific
          sequence of DNA bases. For each color channel i.e. RGB of pixel might
          be represented by a certain DNA bases or combination of bases.
          Overview of Conversion- The value of pixel 0-255 can be converted into
          DNA sequence. Using a set of predefined rules we can map every two bit
          of a 8 bit binary sequence to one of the DNA nucleotides.

          Most image cryptosystems produce quasirandom sequences, wherein the values are predetermined by the initial values supplied to them; these sequences serve as the algorithm's symmetric key, by using 
          specific chaotic maps such as the 2D-Infinite Collapse Map <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[1]</ScrollLink>, Logistic Maps <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[2]</ScrollLink> 3D chen chaotic sysytem <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[3]</ScrollLink>, Hyper Chaotic Systems <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[4]</ScrollLink>, Logistic Tent System <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[5]</ScrollLink>, 4D memristive Hyper Chaos <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[6]</ScrollLink>, Fractional Order Hyperchaotic System <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[7]</ScrollLink>, Fractional Fourier Transform <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[8]</ScrollLink> etc.<br/>
          Different authors have used number of algortihms for color image's encryption. To improve the execution of the cryptosystem, they entails several operations including DNA based encoding, DNA-XOR, DNA complement, DNA decoding, etc. The majority of cryptosystems rely on addition-subtraction (+,-) operations <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[3]</ScrollLink> or XOR operations <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[2,3,4]</ScrollLink>, each of which has certain drawbacks. The disadvantages of using XOR in these operation are proved in paper <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[9]</ScrollLink>. In the same paper to overcome these limitation a new binary operator is proposed which is applicable in both conventional and DNA based cryptosystems.
          This research will use a binary operator (⊗) proposed in paper<ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[9]</ScrollLink>. The operator satisfies the requirements to be utilised with DNA nucleotides and image with pixel depths of 8 and 16 bits.
          A new cryptosystem that can be used to safely and losslessly encrypt color images has been developed in order to demonstrate the operator's viability with color images as well. The cryptosystem performs fairly because it functions well for all color images with different dimensions and it can withstand a variety of attacks.

            <p className="justified">
            An encryption and decryption technique utilising an operator ⊗ is presented in the proposed work. Measurements of the cryptosystem's performance have also been made using the experimental results and analysis. Lastly, a comparison with other operators, such as XOR and addition-subtraction, is carried out.
            <ul>
              <li>The new methods used in the algorithm, such as inter channel mixing, mix rows, spiral mixing are straightforward but have the power to significantly reduce the visual information in the original images</li>
              <li>The cryptosystem utilizes the modified ACM algorithm proposed in paper <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[9]</ScrollLink>, only images with similar dimensions can be shuffled using traditional ACM. Unevenly sized images shuffling is also possible with the modified ACM.</li>
              <li>To improve security and give the encryption process non-linearity, the suggested cryptosystem makes use of DNA encoding, substitution based on DNA with the proposed operator and DNA decoding.</li>
              <li>The cryptosystem has been tested using a number of statistical and security measures, together with experimentation and analysis to improve its performance, to ensure that it is resistant to a variety of threats.</li>
              <li>The comparative analysis shows that suggested operator outperforms other operators, such as XOR or (+,-) with the color images as well, and hence overcomes their shortcomings.</li>

            <p className="justified">
            The cryptosystem makes use of six 2D-Multiple Collapse Chaotic Maps, which are produced by the Key Scheduling Algorithm from a 240-bit symmetric key. <br/>
            The first stage involves intermixing of channels of the image then utilising the proposed operator ⊗ to operate the rows of the intermixed images with the initial array. Using a modified version of Arnold's Cat Map <ScrollLink to='references' smooth={true} duration={50} style={{cursor:'pointer',color:'blue'}}>[10]</ScrollLink>, which can be applied to both square and rectangular images, the pixels of the composite image are jumbled. The suggested operator is then used to further mix the pixels in the directions of forward spiral row, forward spiral column, reverse spiral row, and reverse spiral column. These keyless procedures are necessary to eliminate the link between pixels and the image's visual perception. Lastly, a non-linear layer has been added by combining the suggested operator with the idea of DNA cryptography. One of the eight encoding principle identified by the rule chart is applied to the mixed image that was obtained in the preceding phases, converting it into a sequence of DNA nucleotides. At this stage DNA encoded image is obtained and these encodings are further substituted using proposed operator with the substitution map. Lastly, one of the eight DNA decoding guidelines identified by a different rule chart is applied to decode the substituted DNA sequences.

These seven parts are lengths of 40 bits, 40 bits, 40 bits, 40 bits, 40 bits, 20 bits and 20 bits respectively. The structure of the key is as folllows:
